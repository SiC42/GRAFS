 * Interface for operators which takes a graph and produces one graph.

 * This is only a formal definition and not used in any other way than to provide a visual indicator which operators do what.
 * With the right application it can be possible to provide the operator with graph collections and handle them well internally,
 * however that is not build in automatically.
